# Steps to Retrieve Asset Endpoint Line Numbers

1. Identified the OpenAPI spec file: references/data_api/ccdata_openapi_spec.json.
2. Searched for asset-related endpoints using keywords and context search (e.g., "Asset", "assets", "metadata", "toplist", "search", "summary", "events").
3. Located the start line of each asset endpoint by matching the path key in the JSON.
4. For each endpoint, read the file from its start line to just before the next endpoint to determine the end line.
5. Recorded the start and end line numbers for each endpoint.
6. Saved the results in this file for future reference and automation.
